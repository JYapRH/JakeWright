			<h2>What Did I Change?</h2>
			<p>I modified Jake Wrights website so that it would suit modern browsers of at least 1024 pixels. I did this by changing the unit of measurement from pixels to percentage</p>
			<p>I also changed the fonts of some of the words on the website like the header, the navigation bar and the sub heading as well</p>
			<p>The colours on the website were also changed for the headings as well as the navigation</p>
